      <h3>2019</h3>
      <h2>First year of programming</h2>
      <p>I started programming through scratch. I don't have evidence of my works, since I had to delete my account since someone tried to dox me and my family with it. I worked on basic games like a platformer, and making animations that triggered events through code with a help from a friend.</p>
